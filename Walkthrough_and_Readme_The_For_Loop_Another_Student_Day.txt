The most important note – the game is designed for the GUI, not TextUI. And as amount of text in the game might be large at times, please expand the window as much as possible.
There's also a scrolling feature in GUI, but it always automatically scrolls to the bottom of the respective section.
[This note is also repeated at the bottom of this file and at the bottom of the welcoming message]

The game is completed by obtaining 6 items and bringing them to the base location, “Room” area that goes under “your apartment” name in exits list.

Items are obtained by solving the puzzles. To solve a puzzle a player has to type in a correct phrase.

The items are transferred to the room automatically whenever a player visits the room, provided that he or she carries the items in the inventory. Once the room contains all 6 items, the game finishes.

Guide on obtaining the items (provided a player reached an area by go + exit_name):
In the sweet swede eatery type “break table”
Just go to some area, and a local item will be added automatically – beacause it's a very special area
In lecorbusierinaukio aka Le Corbusier Square type “interview”
In amphitheater type “omstart enough”
In omega bloke type “speaking in tongues”
In office type “no”

A player can also pick up beers scattered around the world
Drinking a beer in location with a puzzle will give a hint to a player
Drinking 3 beers a day will result in a text shuffled
Drinking 4 beers a day will result in a game over

A player can encounter an NPC that randomly moves around the world. It’s a mystical Red Cross woman, which moves very fast.
Interaction with an npc will result in a hint to a random puzzle. A player doesn’t spend any resources on it other than time, but a hint will be shuffled.

There’s a concept of time in the game.
From 9:00 to 21:00 a player can move freely around the world.
After 21:00 the only exits from any location would be a house party and room/your apartment.
If a player is already in the apartment, there are no exists available until the morning.
A player can still stay in the location he or she was at the moment when the evening hits.
If a player spent more than a specified number of days on winning the game, the ending will be different.

If a player went to a house party, the game is over.

There are other new or reworked minor mechanics that a player can try. You can use help command to get the full list of available actions.

Important note on GUI: I tried to implement the scrolling, but it always scrolls to the bottom of a respective section. That’s why I recommend expanding the game window as much as possible prior to starting the game. In times there’s a lot of text, and small window get resulted in worse user experience.

Also, I added different information to the lower left corner of GUI.

Hope I didn’t forget anything. 

Enjoy!
